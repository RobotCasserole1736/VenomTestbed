## Casserole Venom Motor Test

FRC Team 1756 Argos kindly donated four venom motors to us, with the request we run some testing on them prior to the 2020 season.

This repo includes a Java robot project, along with some utilites, to try to run the motors through their paces, do some bug discovery and performance evaluation. Use it as a sample of how to use the Venom motors!
